Summary: Intro to Optimal Kombat and scraping workflow.

Welcome to Optimal Kombat – where we use data to decode the fight game.

This first post is a quick overview of why I started this project, what kind of analysis I'm building, and how you can help shape it.

What This Blog Is About
I'm an analyst with a passion for MMA, using Python to break down fight data, uncover trends, and model fight outcomes. This blog will track my journey as I build analytics tools, test predictive models, and explore fighter performance from a data-driven lens.

Scraping UFC Stats
The first step in this process is scraping structured fight data from UFCStats.com. I’ve built a Python-based scraper that pulls fighter stats round-by-round and stores them as time series. I’ll go into the technical details of the scraper, schema, and challenges in the next post.

What’s Coming
Here’s a quick preview of future content: - Fighter style clustering - Pace & fatigue analysis - Pre-fight modeling + betting angles - Time series evolution of fighters’ stats

Give Me Feedback
I’d love to hear from readers! What kind of insights are you curious about? - Do you want visual breakdowns of matchups? - Deeper dives into performance analytics? - Tutorials or code walkthroughs?

Comment (coming soon), DM me, or message me on GitHub.

Let’s find patterns in the chaos—together.
